is the geometric coordinate system in which each point is represented by an ordered pair $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}$, so the Cartesian plane is formally the Cartesian product of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$

## distance between 2 points
the distance of 2 points in the Cartesian plane si represented by this formula: $d = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$ . This formula works because with $\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2}$ is the same of $|x_1-x_2|$, so we are taking the distance between this 2 points. the same is for the $y$.
## mid point
$Mp = (\frac{x_1+x_2}{2};\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$. for this demonstrate this formula we need to plot a line $\overline{AB}$ , and we know that the $Mp$ = $\overline{AB}\div 2$, so the value of the x in $\overline{AMp} = \overline{MpB}$, and we can write this in a formula: $x-x_A = x_B-x \iff 2x=x_A+x_B \iff x = \frac{x_A+x_B}{2}$, the same is for the $y$.
