# definition
is a rule, we represent theme with name like $f, g, h, ...$, for example $f(x) = x^2$. By definition a function is a rule that $\forall x \in S, \exists! y \in B$. and a function or a map that go from domain A to codomain is represented $f: A \to B$.
- $f(x)$ is read as `f of x` and it is called `image of x under f`
- A si the Domain
- B is the Codomain
- the range , or image, of $f$ is the effective value that reach the $f(x)$ function
## dependent and independent variable
this because y depends by x for his value, for example: $y = f(x)$ means that we take a variable $x$ in our domain and after that apply a rule to take $y$ from the codomain.
- $x$ is called the independent variable
- $y$ is called the dependent variable
![[fncdomain.svg#invert_B]]
it this example we can se the function $y = x^2$, and how it works, the domain and codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, but the images is only $\mathbb{R}^+$. and we have to remember that $x$ cannot have 2 $y$.
The $x$ value is a placeholder for a value of the domain.
# Piece wise function
## definition
are different formulas for different parts of its domain.
$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
39 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 2 \\ 
39 +15(x -2) & \text{if } x > 2 \\ 
\end{cases}
$$
# net change
$f(a) - f(b)$, in this way we can say how many a function changed between these 2 values. For example let $f(x) = x^2$, and $a = 3, b = 1$, we can do $f(3) - f(1) = 9 - 1 = 8$.
## difference quotients
this formula is represented by $\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$. Is a measure of the average rate of change of the function over an interval, if we have 2 points, we can say that $\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x-y}$.
It say us how a value between 2 points, and give us the slope of the line between the 2 points. It say us how change $f(x)$ for each unity of x.

# line function
every line passes at last between 2 points, and his formula is: $f(x) = mx + q$, and his general equation is: $ax+by+c$. 
- $m$ is the slope
- $x$ is our independent variable
- $q$ where the line touch $y$ when $x = 0$ 
![[line.svg#invert_B]]
for example this line is described by the formula $f(x) = 3x+2$, in fact the line touch the $y$ when $x = 0$
## find the slope
for find the slope we use the same formula of the `difference quotients` in facts is $\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$, so we can say how many change for any unity.
## find the line formula
$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $x$ and $y$ are not numbers but are the independent and dependent variables.
