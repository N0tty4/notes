# inductive reasoning
## definition
is used to form hypotheses, explanation based on a set of observations. The explanation or conclusion is called ==conjecture==.
$$
\text{observation} \to \text{conjecture}
$$

#### Example:
Every cat Emily meets purrs -> So every cat purr.
### what it involves?
1. examining few cases
2. observing a pattern
3. assuming that patter will always hold.
### how to prove that is false
we only need to find a case where this observation is false, a counterexample.
#### Example:
if Emily finds a cat that don't purrs, his conjecture will be false.
### Attention
a counterexample proofs that is not ever true, not that the conjecture is ture.
## conditional statement
### definition
have the form if then, like: if a condition is met, then an action is performed.
### prove it
- is true when conclusion occurs for all cases
- to prove that is false, we should present a counterexample that show the statement is false
### parts of it
if (p) then (q): p is called hypotheses, q is called conclusion
#### example
if you stay up all night, then you will be tried at school
- \[you stay up all night] (hypotheses) 
- \[then you will be tried] (conclusion)
it is written as p -> q, if p then q.   
### write regular statements
all fish have gills -> if it is a fish then have gills.
### the converse
for write the converse we have to switch the position of hypotheses and conclusion: if we have p -> q, the converse will be: q -> p.
#### attention
the converse of a true statement is not ever true
##### example:
p -> q: if is see a dog the i smile
q -> p: if is smile i see a dog
##### math example:
p -> q: if $x = 5$, then $x^2 = 25$ 
q -> p: if $x^2 = 25$, then $x = 5$, it is not ever true because $x = -5$
## bi-conditional statement 
## definition
is a conditional statement that is true and his converse is also true:
- \[true conditional] + \[true converse] = bi-conditional
- is written as: p if and only if q
- $p \iff q$
# deductive reasoning
## definition
uses given facts and statements to reach a logical conclusion.
### low of deduction reasoning
- low of Detachment:
  if p -> q is true, and p is true, then q is true
  #### example:
  if i drink i can't drive, so if i have drunk.
  i know know that i am drunk and this conditional statement is true, so i can't drive.
  #### math example:
  if $\angle A$ and $\angle B$ are vertical angles, then $\angle A = \angle B$.
  i know that $\angle A$ and $\angle B$ are verticale angels, and i know that this conditional statement is true, so i know that $\angle A = \angle B$.
- low of Syllogism:
  if p -> q, and q -> r, then p -> r.
