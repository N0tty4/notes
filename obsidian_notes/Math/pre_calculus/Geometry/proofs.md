# definition
A proof, or logical argument, ca be used to show that a conjecture is true. We use property of equality, congruence, other proven theorems, postulates and soon for prove.
# types of proofs
## 2-column proofs
### definition
we arrange in 2 columns tabe, the left one contain the given statement, in the the right column we write the proof for the statement.
Reasons can be:
- given information
- theorems
- postulates
- definition
- properties
### example
lets prove that if $\angle PQR$ is a right angle, and is a adjacent angle, Prove $\angle 1$, $\angle 2$ are complementary angle. 
$$
\begin{array}{|c||c|}
	\hline
	\text{Statements} & \text{Reasons} \\
	\hline
	\angle PQR = 90^{\circ} & \text{by the definition of right angle} \\
	\angle 1 = \angle 2 - 90^{\circ} & \text{by the definition of complementar} \\
	\angle 2 = \angle 1 - 90^{\circ} & \text{by the definiton of complementar} \\
	\angle 2 + \angle 1 = 90^{\circ} & \text{definition of complementar angle} \\
	\hline
	
\end{array} 
$$
## flowchart proof
### definition
is a diagram that uses boxes and arrows to show the logical order of each statement leading to a conclusion.
## paragraph proof
### definition
explains why a conjecture is true in paragraph form, It follows logical steps and given reasons for them.
### example
Prove vertical angles $\angle 1$, $\angle 2$ are congruent:
	- we are given that $\angle 1$  and $\angle 2$ are vertical angles. Since linear pair angles are supplementary. $m\angle 1 + m\angle 3 = 180^{\circ}$, and  $m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = 180^{\circ}$. Using subtraction: $m\angle 1 + m\angle 3 = m\angle 2 + m\angle 3$ so the equation says that $m\angle 1 = m\angle 2$.
