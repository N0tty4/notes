# Point
un punto è una precisa posizione, non ha dimensione, è un concetto astratto.
# line
La linea retta si può definire come un insieme di punti che giacciono nella stessa direzione e che formano il percorso più breve per connettere 2 punti.
# line segment
is a part of line that is bounded by two distinct end points.
# ray
is a part of a line that have a fixed starting point but not a endpoint, it extend infinitely in only one direction.
# vertex
is the intersection of 2 or more line segments, rays or lines. for example, when the line $\overline{AB}$  intersects the line $\overline{CD}$ it creates 4 angles but only one vertex. because is the point when they intersect.
# angles
is formed by 2 ray that have the same start point in common (the vertex).
# triangles
is the shape that have 3 sides and 3 angles and the sum of his inner angles make $180^\circ$.
# parallel or perpendicular lines
- parallel: are 2 or more lines that have the same distance for alle the points, them never meet: $\overline{AB}\parallel \overline{CD}$.
- perpendicular: 2 line that intersect and form a right angle: $\overline{AB} \perp \overline{CD}$. 
# Plane
is a flat surface (2-dimensional) that extends infinitely in all directions. if 2 points is on the same plane, they are co-planar.
## intersection
we seen that if 2 line or segment lines or ray and line are intersected, they have only one common point, but if we intersect 2 planes they have a common line. But if we intersect a line with a plane, they will have only one point in common.
# postulates and theorems
- postulate is a statement that is considered ever true with no demonstration
- theorem is a statement that has to been proven to be true using others theorems, definitions or postulates.
## line postulate
if $B$ is a point on the line $\overline{AC}$, then $AB + BC = AC$. It is an example. because it is obvious.
## congruent segment
2 lines are congruent if have the same length.
## segment bisector
bisect means "divide into 2 parts equal", and is everything that devise a segment in 2 equal parts, can be line, ray, line segment or a plane.
