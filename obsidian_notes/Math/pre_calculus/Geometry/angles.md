# definition
a angle $\angle$ is formed by 2 rays with a common start point.
# name
can be named in 3 ways
1. with the symbol $\angle A$, that indicate where the angle is formed
2. with $\angle ABC$, which indicate that we are taking about the angle that is on B
3. with the number that indicate the angle $\angle 1$ 
# name of angles
An angle have a interior part and a exterior part, and are classified:
- acute angle if: $m\angle A < 90^\circ$
- right angle if: $m \angle A = 90^\circ$ 
- obtuse angel if: $90^\circ < m\angle A < 180^\circ$
- straight angle if: $m\angle A = 180^\circ$
## angle addition postulate
if a point $R$ is inside an angle $\angle QPS$, then the angle formed with the point $R$ is $\angle QPR$ and angle $\angle RPS$, and as for the line postulate, $\angle QPR + \angle RPS$ = $\angle QPS$.
## congruent angles
2 angles are congruent if their angle measure are equal.
# angle pairs
2 angles can be related to each other by:
- measures
- orientation
these are called `angle pairs`
## types
1. adjacent angles:
  - share a common side
  - have a common vertex
  - lie on the same plane
  - have no common interior parts

2. vertical angles ==angoli opposti al vertice==:
   - are not adjacent
   - are opposite each other
   - formed when 2 lines intersect
   - share same vertex
   - they are congruent $\angle 1 = \angle 3, \angle 2 = \angle 4$.
# definitions
## complementary:
if the sum of 2 angels = $90^\circ$: $35^\circ + 55^\circ = 90^\circ$.
## supplementary:
if the sum of 2 angels = $180^\circ$: $135^\circ + 45^\circ = 180^\circ$.
## linear pair:
are adjacent and supplementary.
## angles bisector:
is a ray that have the same start point of the angle but divide it in 2 congruent angles.
## perpendicular bisector:
is a ray, line, segment that divides in to 2 part a line segment, and form 4 angle of $90^\circ$ with the segment.
