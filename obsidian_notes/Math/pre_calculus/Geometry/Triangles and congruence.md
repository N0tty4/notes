# type of triangles
## a polygon
is a two-dimensional (flat) closed figure with at lats three straight sides.
## triangle 
is a polygon with three sides and three angles. we for indicate a triangle use the symbol $\triangle ABC$, that is followed by the letter of the three vertices.
### example
- triangle = $\triangle ABC$
- sides = $\overline{AB}, \overline{AC}, \overline{BC}$
- vertices: $A, B, C$
### types of triangles by sides
we can classify triangles by their sides:
#### equilateral
have 3 congruent sides and 3 congruent angles
#### isosceles
have 2 congruent sides and 2 congruent angles
#### scalene
have 3 different sides and 3 different angles
### types of triangles by angles
#### acute
all angles are $< 90^{\circ}$
#### obtuse
one angle is $> 90^{\circ}$ 
#### right
1 angle $= 90^\circ$ 
#### equianglular triangle
have all 3 congruent angles
## isosceles triangles
in a isosceles triangle the sides that are equal in length are called the legs. The third side is called the base. The angles opposite the legs are called the base angles.
### isosceles triangles base
if two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite those sides are congruent.
### converse of isosceles triangle theorem
if two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite those angles are also congruent.
# interior and exterior angles
## Interior angle
### definition
the angles inside a triangle are the interior angles
### triangle angle-sum theory
the sum of the measures of the three interior angles is $180^\circ$
## exterior angles
The angles on the outside of the triangle are the exterior angles. Remember that the interior angle and the exterior are supplementary to each outer, so $\text{interior angle} + \text{exterior angle} = 180^{\circ}$.
### exterior angle sum
the measure of the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two nonadjacent angles.
## congruence
### definition
congruent polygons have the same shape and size. Their corresponding angles and corresponding sides are congruent.
if $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ are congruent, the corresponding angles are congruent: $\angle A = \angle D$, $\angle B = \angle E$, $\angle C = \angle F$
### side-side-side congruence
if the three of one triangle are congruent to the three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
If we knew this then the angles will also be congruent.
### side-angle-side congruence
if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent
### angle-side-angle
if two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the included side of another triangle,then the triangles are congruent.
### angle-angle-side
if two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the corresponding non-included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
# triangle bisectors
## definition
Perpendicular bisector always cross a line segment at right angle ($90^{\circ}$), cutting it into two equal parts.
## perpendicular bisector theorem
if a point is on the perpendicular of a line segment, then the point is equidistant to the segment endpoints.
### converse perpendicular bisector
if a point is equidistant to the endpoints of a segment, then it is no the perpendicular bisector of that segment.
## concurrent
when three or more lines intersect at one point, they are concurrent. Their point of intersection is called point of concurrency.
### circumcenter
in a triangle, there are three perpendicular bisectors, that all meet at one point, the circumcenter. It can be inside or outside the triangle.
If we draw a circle through the three vertices of any triangle, the circumcenter will be the center of the circle.
#### circumcenter theorem
the circumcenter is equidistant to the vertices.
## Incenter
in a triangle, the angle bisector of the three interior angle s all meet at one point. This point is at the center of the triangle and is called the incenter.

### incenter theorem
the incenter is equidistant to the sides of the triangle.
## Median
a median of a triangle is a line from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
### centroid
every triangle has three medians which meet at a point called the centroid.
### centroid theorem
the centroid is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the distane from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
## altitude and orthocenter
### altitude
is the line segment from a vertex to the opposite side and perpendicular to that side, can be inside or outside the triangle, every triangle has three altitude.
### orthocenter
can be inside or outside the triangle, are the point where the altitudes of the triangle meets.
# Triangle inequalities
When comparing two sides of a triangle, the angle opposite the longer side is larger than the angle opposite the shorter side.
$$
	\overline{AB} > \overline{BC} \iff m\angle C > m\angle A
$$
## triangle inequalities theorem:
the sum of two sides of a triangle will be ever bigger than the third side
$$
	AB + BC > AC,


	BC + AC > AB, 


	AB + AC > BC
$$
