# angles
## corresponding angles postulates
if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, they corresponding angels are congruent.
## alternate interior angles theorem
if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then their alternate interior angles are congruent.
## alternate exterior angles theorem
if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then their alternate exterior angles are congruent.
## same side angles
When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, then their same-side interior angles are supplementary
# line
the converse of the parallel line theorems and postulates are true
## converse of corresponding angle postulate
if corresponding angles are congruent, then the liens are parallel
## converse of alternate interior angles theorem
if alterante interior alternate angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel
## converse of same-side interior angles theorem
if same-side interior angles are supplementary, then the lines are parallel.
## converse alternate exterior angles theorem
if alternate exterior angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel
